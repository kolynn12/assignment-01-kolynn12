## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

What did I learn, what confused me, where did I struggle, where might I need to pratice.
I learned how to use the python debugger tool, and how to make breakpoints in the code to help with the debugging process. The numbers task also helped me refresh my memory of loops. At first, I struggled to remember which type of loop to use (for or while), and it took me a few tries to get it right. I used a while loop so that the loop would stop when the condition input=0 occurred. I was confused by the tests because I kept failing them, and I really struggled with trying to make my numbers code run. In the end, the part I struggled with was matching the format in the test's expected answers (I started with two lists (an odd_list and an even_list, and then printed them together instead of making a dictionary of lists), and forgot to make the input integers instead of strings, etc.). I need to practice these kinds of detail-oriented tasks because they will help my code be more concise and effective.
